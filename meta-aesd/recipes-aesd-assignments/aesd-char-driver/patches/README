After the patch is generated from Assignments-3-and-later, its file path has to be manually changed from

`aesd-char-driver/Makefile`

to

`Makefile`

This is beause the working directory of the recipe is already set to `aesd-char-driver`. So the original patch `aesd-char-driver/Makefile` makes BitBake look for `aesd-char-driver/aesd-char-driver/Makefile`, which doesnt exist.
